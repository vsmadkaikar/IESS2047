This directory contains the following files:

* `test.xlsx` - A simple example spreadsheet following the conventions of models
  from the 2050 Calculators project. This is included only as a reference for
  the other files.
* `_interface2050.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` and `interface2050.py` - A
  compiled library and Python interface for `test.xlsx`. Produced using
  https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/calc2050_spreadsheet_converter
* `web_outputs.json` - A simplified dummy version of the web_outputs.json in the
  project root directory. Based on the Mackay calculator spreadsheet rather than
  `test.xlsx`
